Welcome to the classic interview question, FizzBuzz. FizzBuzz is designed to test a candidates basic understanding of the fundamentals of a language. The basic understand of FizzBuzz is to create a function that will print "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

 

Setup a GitHub repository and local git repository
We don't have a script that will do this for python, so you have 2 options:
Create a copy of the projectStarter script and modify the copy to work for a simple python file
Do the steps manually (create the repo, clone it, create the python inside of that cloned repo)
Create a python script that achieves the following:
Have a function that takes in one number as an argument
This function will:
print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
The function should only ever print once per number!
Hard code a list of random numbers with at least 15 numbers inside
Run the function created for each number in your list.
Once the script is working git add, commit and push your code
 

HINT: You will need to use the "Modulo" operator.
